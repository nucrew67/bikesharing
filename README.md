# Analysis (24 points)

The written analysis has the following:

    -Overview of the statistical analysis:
        The purpose of this analysis is to provide a business proposal that will convince investors that developing a bike-sharing program in Des Moines can be a profitable venture. Throughout the process, we use data that is publicly available from the NYC CitiBike program archives and Tableau to create visualizations.

While the data is based on activity that occurred in New York City which is very different from Des Moines, we use our data expertise and critical thinking skills to build a story that can be presented to the investors.

For our presentation, we decide to use data from August 2019 to build our analysis. It is assumed that there is more traffic or usage during the summer months compared to other times of the year in which weather can impact activity.
